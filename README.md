Overview of the Statistical Analysis:
     The purpose of this project was to analyze rain trends in Hawaii between June and December to assess the viability of opening a surf shop.

Results:
-	The average temperature was about 4 degrees warmer in June versus December
-	The minimum temperature was about 8 degrees warmer in June versus December
-	The maximum temperature was about 2 degrees warmer in June versus December

Summary:
     Two additional queries that Iâ€™d like to evaluate include average rainfall and hours of daylight.
